# HTTPS-and-CSS-Projects
This is the repository for projects from AoL
It contains simple skeletons of html sites, good done, reflecting minimal css tasks on the done list, whatever :) 
I hope it's enjoyable experiencing the love of digital doges and life affirming messages as you look through!
It's gratitude for getting to work on these html and css skills that let me be happy.
Questions are welcome, I will try to respond.
